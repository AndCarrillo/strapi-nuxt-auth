## Installation & Setup

1. Create a Strapi project by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx create-strapi-app@latest backend
   ```

   Answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù to all questions.

2. You should now have a new Strapi app with a default SQLite database. To start it in development mode, open your project and run:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run develop
   ```
3. Once the project is running, Strapi will automatically open in your browser at [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin). Create the admin user to access the Strapi admin panel.

## Social Providers Setup

1. Go to **Settings > Providers** in the Strapi admin panel under the Users & Permissions plugin section.
2. Enable the **GitHub** provider by clicking the pencil icon on the right and copy the redirect URL.

```bash
http://localhost:1337/api/connect/github/callback
```

## Creating the OAuth App in GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
2. Click "New OAuth App" and fill in the fields:

   - **Application Name**: Choose a descriptive name.
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: Use the redirect URL provided by Strapi:
     ```
     http://localhost:1337/api/connect/github/callback
     ```
   - You can refer to the following image:
